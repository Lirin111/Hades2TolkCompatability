# Hades 2 TOLk Compatibility

Hades II mod which is a dependency of accessibility mods, using H2M we implement a screen reader through TOLk, one which replaces many of the icons in the game with the text they actually represent.

## Features

- On Mousing over a button, the text within the button is read
- Icons within text are replaced by corresponding text [respects localization in most cases] (ie the Magick symbol is replaced by the word "Magick")

## Install

- Download off of thunderstore
